## Hi there!
I am a second-year PhD student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), advised by [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/index.html). Previously, I was a research master's student (MLT) at [Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), working with [Teruko Mitamura](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~teruko/) and [Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io/).

Prior to CMU, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science, and Mathematics & Economics from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). During my undergrad study, I spent two years at [Knowledge Computation Group@HKUST](https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp), where I was advised by [Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). I was also a research intern at CLSP, JHU supervised by Benjamin Van Durme.

## Research Themes
I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing. My (current) goal of research is to build intelligent systems that can _communicate_ and _collaborate_ with humans in _dynamic environments_ for solving complex real-world tasks. Under this theme, I would like to explore:

- **Language Grounding:** How can we tie language to the surrounding world (e.g. multimodal context/embodied environment)? And by doing so, can we obtain the language representation that is aware of perception, knowledge, and dynamics of the world?
- **Interaction:** With the tremendous progress in the development and deployment of AI models (e.g. ChatGPT), how should we adapt these models to interact more effectively with human users? 

I regard these two directions to be highly _inter-connected_ and _mutually beneficial_: to use language as the mean of system-human interaction, grounding the communication to contexts helps the system understand user preference and intent so that to adjust its behavior accordingly to enable better collaboration.

In the past, I also worked on information extraction, controlled generation, discourse analysis, and knowledge graph completion.
